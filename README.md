Hi! I'm its.ssskye, you can call me Skye, I have a lot of skills, but I like to call them interests to not sound like I'm boasting, if it helps here's a list of my ~~skills~~ interests:
What I'm pretty good at:
Video Editing
Writing
Programming
Game Developing

What I'm a real rookie at:
3D Art
Art
Thumbnail Designing
Sound Producing
Music Composing

I'm also a human if that's interesting, and I'm open to dms!
<small>PLEASE DM ME, I'M BEGGING YOU, I HAVE NO FRIENDS, PLEASEE</small>

I love Minecraft and ~~suffering~~ staying inside where the grass can't touch me, I also do some Arduino stuff like an engineer, but not like an engineer, you see, I'm just an average human who ~~has no friends~~ loves meeting new people and collabing or make something with them, or just hand out in general, you can DM me on my Discord or my Instagram where I'm most active or choose to DM me on Twitter to get a reply in a month, another option is to send an email to me and you would get a response in 2 weeks or so, yes, i check my email more often than my twitter, cut some slack, anyways you can out my socials [here](https://itsssskye.carrd.co) and potentially be my new friend, now I must go, see you soon!
